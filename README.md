### Project Description : 

* In this Project, I implemented a comprehensive data quality management framework that integrates automated validation, cleansing processes, and real-time monitoring within Apache Airflow-based data pipelines. This framework includes distinct DAGs for data cleansing, quality assessment and performance evaluation, ensuring each aspect of the data pipeline is handled efficiently and independently. The real-time monitoring system triggers subsequent DAGs based on the detection of data anomalies, allowing for dynamic and adaptive responses to data quality issues.

### Tools 
* Python
* Airflow
